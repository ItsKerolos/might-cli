# Might

## Intro

This project is still a work-in-progress, it's unstable, incomplete and updates will probably break all of your tests.

Our goal is to make a no-code method to add end-to-end tests to any web app.

## Installation
`
npm install --save-dev might-cli
`

## Usage

You need a config file and a tests file.

`
npx might
`

The CLI will create them for you and walk you through the rest.
